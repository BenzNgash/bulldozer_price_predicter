# Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers using Machine Learning

This repository contains an example machine learning project focused on predicting the sale price of bulldozers based on their characteristics and historical sales data.

## 1. Problem Definition
The goal of this project is to predict the sale price of bulldozers, given a set of features and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for. The prediction model will be evaluated on how accurately it can estimate the price, which could be useful for determining pricing strategies or assessing market trends.

## 2. Data
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition, which provides historical data on bulldozer sales. The dataset is split into three main subsets:

- **Train.csv**: The training dataset that contains information up to the end of 2011.
- **Valid.csv**: The validation dataset that spans from January 1, 2012, to April 30, 2012. Predictions on this dataset are used to determine the public leaderboard ranking.
- **Test.csv**: The test dataset, which covers May 1, 2012, to November 2012. This dataset is only used for the final evaluation, and the results will determine the final competition ranking.

You can access the dataset here: [Dataset Link]

## 3. Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using a suitable regression metric such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), as the task is a regression problem aimed at predicting continuous sale prices.

## 4. Dependencies

To run this project, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
- `matplotlib`: For creating visualizations.
- `seaborn`: For data visualization (optional, for improved plotting).
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing, and evaluation.
- `xgboost`: For gradient boosting models (if used in the project).
- `lightgbm`: For LightGBM models (if applicable).
- `joblib`: For saving and loading trained models (if applicable).

### Installation

You can install all the dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can install each library individually with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm joblib
```

If you need to create a `requirements.txt` file for the project, you can generate it by running:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
